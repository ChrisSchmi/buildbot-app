[[_developer_setup]]
== Developer Setup

I’m using a Fedora Linux 37 on my local machine and for most of the
containers.

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kwk/buildbot-app.git && cd buildbot-app 
$ sudo dnf install -y direnv golang podman podman-compose buildbot pandic asciidoctor 
$ go install github.com/cespare/reflex@latest 
$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc 
export PATH=\${PATH}:~/go/bin
eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"
EOF
$ source ~/.bashrc 
$ direnv allow . 
$ make infra-start 
$ make app 
----

* Clone the repo.
* Install tools we need/use for development locally. If this was a
deployment site the only requirement is buildbot so that the github app
can make a call to `buildbot try`.
* Install hot-reload tool.
* Make tools above available upon next source of `.bashrc`.
* Reload `.bashrc` to have `direnv` and `reflex` working in your current
shell.
* Navgigate out and back into the project directory to have `direnv`
kickin. If this doesn’t work, try `direnv allow .`.
* Bring up local containers for a buildbot setup with one master and
three workers.
* Run and hot reload the app code upon changes being made to any of your
`*.go` files or your `.envrc` file.
